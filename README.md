# Discrete Fracture Network generation and sampling code ->Rock mass Joint Network Simulation

It is essentially a Matlab Toolbox consisting several dozens of function coded by authors.The position, orientation, and size of joints are independent of each other with in this toolbox. Theposition,namely the jointcenter, follows a Poisson's distribution. Theorientation can be either deterministic or has a Fisherd istribution while the joint size can be any form of distribution. Please refer the word document RJNS3D函数简介和测试.doc for detailed explnation of each of the function.
